# Monkey Island: Scumm Bar Brawl

This is a fan made mini game based on the insult sword fighting system in the Monkey Island computer game series.

## How to play

Play as our hero, Guybrush Threepwood, in a sword fight against a deadly pirate.

During the sword fight there may come a natural break in the swordplay where one pirate will launch an insult such as "You fight like a Dairy Farmer". 

The opponent will then be forced to respond with a comeback. If the comeback is sufficiently insulting, they will win the upper hand in the battle. If not, they will be fought down. Whoever retains the upper hand will be able to throw the next insult.

Usually three successfully landed insults will ensure a combatants victory.
